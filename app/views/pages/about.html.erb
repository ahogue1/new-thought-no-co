      <h3>Our Service</h3>
      <p>
        Our Sunday mornings are a time of connection with inspired messages taken from New Thought teachings, ancient wisdom, and contemporary educators and authors.  We engage in peaceful contemplation and affirmative prayer.  We find inspiration in everything from the Bible to Star Wars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music is an important part of our Sunday service, with our band and singers offering songs from multiple genres including Rock, Pop, Country, and even Classical and Spiritual, all with positive, celebratory themes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We start each week by blessing our kids as they head off to experience their own transformational classes.

      <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        New Thought philosophy is a compilation of ancient spiritual truths, philosophical wisdom and modern scientific discoveries.   The spiritual principles we teach and live by are very familiar to most people without them even realizing it.  You may have heard our long-standing motto: “Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life”.  New Thought is a philosophy that emphasizes positive thinking that leads to positive results.  It is a way of life that focuses on living joyfully in the present, free from fear, and knowing that God/the Universe/a power greater than ourselves is for us and not against us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that God, known to many by many names and through many traditions, is an immediate Presence not only around but also within every person.  We believe that this Presence is an invisible law, force, and intelligence that governs everything in the universe. We, as individuals, endeavor to discover our immediate relationship to that Power and to become partners in its activities so that we may create lives that we love to live.
